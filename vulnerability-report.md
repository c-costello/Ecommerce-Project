# Vulnerability Report

## 1 - SQL Injection
#### Exposure
When using SQL injection, databases can be vunerable if proper steps aren't taken. SQL injection is where a user inputs something, such as a username, that includes a SQL command. That way, when that SQL command is called using that string, an additional SQL command runs.
#### Repair
We avoid this problem by using lamda expressions instead of SQL statements to gather data from the table. This way there is no potential for odd SQL calls to be made. Were we using SQL statements, the best way to avoid danger is to not concatinate strings into a SQL statement.

## 2 - Using components with known vulnerabilities
#### Exposure
If a developer does not use the most up to date packages, there is potential for weaknesses that can be exploited by external forces. The best way to ensure this does not happen is to run a check on your packages.
#### Repair
We ran a check on all the packages we have installed, and found that they were indeed the most up to date. No repair needed, but running the check was a good idea.
